## Analysis and Findings
**Competitive Landscape Analysis**
We analyzed market share versus average price to understand how different pricing strategies impact market presence. Merchants with prices below the average (Rp178,380) generally capture more market share, while higher-priced merchants are limited to approximately 1.55% market share.

**Price Analysis**
Our price analysis identified the optimal price range for laptop sleeves on Tokopedia. The top 5 merchants by market share have prices ranging from Rp55,000 to Rp299,900, with an average price of Rp153,759.

**Product Description Analysis**
By analyzing product descriptions, we identified key selling points such as size, durability, color variations, and compatibility with specific devices like MacBook Air and Pro. Keywords like "grey," "scratch-resistant," and "MacBook Air" significantly boost sales, while the term "soft" may have a negative impact.

**Customer Review Analysis**
Customer reviews highlight the importance of fast delivery, secure packaging, accurate product quality, and consistency between product descriptions and the actual product. These factors are crucial for improving customer satisfaction and driving sales.

## Recommendations
- **Adjust Pricing Strategies:** Merchants with above-average prices should consider enhancing the perceived value of their products or adjusting prices to align closer to the market average.
- **Leverage High-Impact Keywords:** Optimize product descriptions with keywords like "grey," "scratch-resistant," and "MacBook Air" to increase sales.
- **Improve Customer Experience:** Focus on delivering fast, secure, and accurate service to enhance customer satisfaction and encourage positive reviews.
